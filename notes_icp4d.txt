- IBM Cloud Pak for Data is a unified, pre-integrated data and AI platform that runs natively on RedHat OpenShift Container platform. 
- Services are delivered with an open and extensible cloud native platform for collecting, organizing, and analyzing data. 
- Itâ€™s a single interface to perform end-to-end analytics with built-in governance. 
- It also supports and governs the end-to-end AI workflow.

Architecture
------------
- IBM Cloud Pak for Data is composed of pre-configured microservices that run on a multi-node IBM Cloud Private cluster. 
- The microservices enable you to connect to your data sources so that you can catalog and govern, explore and profile, transform, and analyze your data from a single web application.
- IBM Cloud Pak for Data is deployed on a multi-node Kubernetes cluster, using RedHat OpenShift. 
- Although you can deploy IBM Cloud Pak for Data on a 3-node cluster, it is strongly recommended that you deploy your production environment on a cluster with at least 6 nodes for better performance, better cluster stability, and increased ease of scaling the cluster to support workload growth.
