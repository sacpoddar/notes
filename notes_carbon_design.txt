- Carbon is IBMâ€™s open-source design system
- consists of working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines
- The goals of the design system
1. improving UI consistency and quality, 
2. making the design and development process more efficient and focused, 
3. establishing a shared vocabulary between designer and developer, and 
4. providing clear, discoverable guidance around design and development best practices.
5. ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.

- maintain a set of Sketch libraries containing Carbon components and patterns
- Sketch Libraries are Sketch documents with components (Symbols, Text Styles and Layer Styles) that you can share across all of your other documents
- Sketch is a vector graphics editor for macOS. $$PAID Software
	- It is primarily used for user interface and user experience design of websites and mobile apps
	- drag and drop interface 
	- The files designed in Sketch are saved in its own .sketch file format
	- Also supports prototyping and colllaboration
	- Sketch is essentially a version of Photoshop built from the ground up to suit the workflow of web designers.

- Carbon supports multiple code implementations. 
1. React	- Carbon React library. https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/buttons--default
2. CSS/Vanilla
3. Angular - Carbon Angular library. https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--basic  Collection of reusable Angular components
4. Vue

- Adopting the library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work.
- Similar to primrfaces(for JSF). PrimeNG (for Angular)

- Design Tools
1. Sketch. Paid. https://www.sketch.com/
2. Axure. Paid. https://www.axure.com/download
3. Adobe XD. Paid.  https://www.adobe.com/in/products/xd.html

Progressive web app
-------------
- PWA is a web application that has a set of capabilities (similar to native apps) which provide an app-like experience to users. 
- Some other capabilities include full responsiveness and browser compatibility, connectivity independence and self-updates.
