GROUP BY functions ( aggregation )
----------------
- Aggregate functions
count()
SUM()
avg()
min()
max()

window functions ( aggregation + keep details )
------------
- Aggregate functions
count()
SUM()
avg()
min()
max()
- Rank functions
row_number()
rank()
dense_rank()
cume_dist()
percent_rank()
ntile()
- Value functions
lead()
lag()
first_value()

Sales schema
==========
Products (productid, product, category, price)
Orders (orderid, productid, customerid, salespersonid, orderdate, shipdate, orderstatus, shipaddress, billaddress, quantity, sales, creationtime)
Customers (customerid, firstname, lastname, country, score)
Employees (employeeid, firstname, lastname, deapartment, birthdate, gender, salary, managerid)



-- Find the total sales across all orders
SELECT SUM(sales) total_sales
FROM Orders

-- Find the total sales for each product
SELECT productid, SUM(sales) total_sales
FROM Orders
GROUP BY productid

-- Find the total sales for each product, additionally provide orderid, orderdate
SELECT orderid, orderdate, productid,
    SUM(sales) OVER(PARTITION BY productid) total_sales
FROM Orders

- Window syntax
    WindowFn | OVER( Partition clause, Order clause, Frame clause )
    e.g.  AVG(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY orderdate ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
- Over clause - tells SQL that the function used is a window function. It defines a window or a subset of data 
- PARTITION BY - divides the result set into partitions (windows) 
    e.g.
    SUM(sales) OVER()
    SUM(sales) OVER(PARTITION BY productid)
    SUM(sales) OVER(PARTITION BY productid, orderstatus)    // for each combination of productid, orderstatus

-- Find the total sales across all orders
    additionally provide orerid, orderdate
SELECT
orderid,
orderdate,
SUM(sales) OVER() TotalSales
FROM Orders

-- Find the total sales for each product
    additionally provide orerid, orderdate
SELECT
orderid,
orderdate,
SUM(sales) OVER(PARTITION BY productid) SalesByProduct
FROM Orders

-- Find the total sales across all orders and 
    Find the total sales for each product and 
    Find the total sales for each product, orderstatus
    additionally provide orerid, orderdate
SELECT
orderid,
orderdate,
orderstatus,
sales,
SUM(sales) OVER() TotalSales
SUM(sales) OVER(PARTITION BY productid) SalesByProduct
SUM(sales) OVER(PARTITION BY productid, orderstatus) SalesByProductAndStatus
FROM Orders

- For rank functions and value functions ORER BY clause is a must
    e.g. RANK() OVER( PARTITION BY month ORDER BY sales DESC )

-- Rank each order based on their sales from highest to lowest
    additionally provide orderid, orderdate
SELECT
    orderid, orderdate,
    sales,
    RANK() OVER( ORDER BY sales DESC) sales_rank
FROM Orders

- Window Frame
    Defines a subset of rows within each window 
    e.g. ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING

    AGV(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY orderdate)
        ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
        -----        -----------     ----------------------
    Frame types     Frame boundry(L)         Frame boundry(H)
    - ROWS          - CURRENT ROW               - CURRENT ROW
    - RANGE         - N PRECEDING               - N FOLLOWING
                    - UNBOUNDED PRECEDING       - UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

- Frame clause can only be used together with order by clause
- Lower value must be before the higher value

SUM(sales) OVER ( ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 2 FOLLOWING )

SUM(sales) OVER ( ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING )

SUM(sales) OVER ( ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW )

SUM(sales) OVER ( PARTITION BY orderstatus ORDER BY orderdate) totalsales

SUM(sales) OVER ( PARTITION BY orderstatus ) totalsales

- Window function can be used only in SELECT clause and ORDER BY clause
- Nesting window function is not allowed
- SQL execute window function after WHERE clause
- Window function can be used together with GROUP BY in the same query, only if same columns are used    

-- Rank customers based on their total sales
SELECT 
    customerid,
    SUM(sales) totalsales,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC) rankcutomers
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customerid
