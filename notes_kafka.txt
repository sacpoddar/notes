Kafka Notes
============

Kafka Topics
- Topics: a particular stream of data
- Like a table in a database (without all the constraints)
- You can have as many topics as you want
- A topic is identified by its name
- Any kind of message format
- The sequence of messages is called a data stream
- You cannot query topics, instead, use Kafka Producers to send data and Kafka Consumers to read the data

Partitions and offsets
- Topics are split in partitions (example: 100 partitions)
    - Messages within each partition are ordered
    - Each message within a partition gets an incremental id, called offset
- Kafka topics are immutable: once data is written to a partition, it cannot be changed

Topics, partitions and offsets 
- Once the data is written to a partition, it cannot be changed (immutability)
- Data is kept only for a limited time (default is one week - configurable)
- Offset only have a meaning for a specific partition.
    - E.g. offset 3 in partition 0 doesn't represent the same data as offset 3 in partition 1
    - Offsets are not re-used even if previous messages have been deleted
- Order is guaranteed only within a partition (not across partitions)
- Data is assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is provided
- You can have as many partitions per topic as you want
