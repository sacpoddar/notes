Shell scripting
===============

# comment

- Shell script starts with shebang construct e.g.
	 #!/bin/sh		(Bourne shell) or
	 #!/bin/bash	(Bourne Again shel)

- E.g.
$ cat first.sh
#!/bin/sh
# Author : Sac
echo "enter name"
read NAME
echo "hello $NAME"

$ chmod +X first.sh			// make it executble
$ ./first.sh				// to run

Variables
----------------
- By convention all shell variables names are in UPPERCASE.

$ cat var1.sh
#!/bin/bash
NAME="sac"
echo "hi $NAME"
readonly NAME	# After a variable is marked read-only, its value cannot be changed
NAME="sac2"     # ERROR: NAME: readonly variable

- Unsetting or deleting a variable directs the shell to remove the variable from the list of variables that it tracks
- You cannot use the unset command to unset variables that are marked readonly.

unset NAME			# unsets variable NAME
echo "hello $NAME"	# will print- hello

- Variable types
1. Local Variables
2. Environment Variables
3. Shell Variables

special variables

$0		# filename of current script e.g. echo $0
$n		# arguments with which a script was invoked. starting with $1
$#		# number of arguments supplied to a script
$*		# all the args
$@		# all the args.
$?		# exit status of the last command executed
