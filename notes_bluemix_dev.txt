IBM Cloud CLI
--------------
- to manage applications, containers, infrastructures, services and other resources in IBM Cloud.
bluemix api https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net
cd ~/dev/bluemix/cfbook
bluemix api https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net
bluemix login -u sac.poddar@gmail.com -o org_name -s space_name
bluemix app push cfbook

git clone https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/get-started-tomcat

Cloud Foundry CLI
--------------------
bluemix cf -h		// help
bluemix cf -h -a		// all help
bluemix cf -v		// version
bluemix login -u sac.poddar@gmail.com -o org_name -s space_name
bluemix target		// list target
bluemix cf logout 
bluemix cf passws	// change password
bluemix cf domains	// list domains
bluemix cf domain	
cf apps	// list apps

Q1: cf login -a option is needed to set the
A: API endpoint
Q2: Which cf cli command allows you to set the organization?
A: target
Q3: Orphaned routes are routes that are ____________ to any application
A: not attached
Q4: You just need to use cf create-domain to be able to create custom routes to your apps, no further action is needed
A: False
Q5: Which command is used for getting information about an app?
A: cf app
Q6: cf push command requires you to provide the ________ or/and __________
A) Manifest file
B) Application binaries (e.g., war file)
C) Command line parameters
D) API endpoint
A: A and C
Q7: You built an application that loads large amount of data at startup. You used the cf push command 
and received a timeout error and a message indicating the 0 of 1 instance started. How would you address the issue?
A: Mainfest file set a higher value for timeout; the default is 60 sec and that does not seem to be 
enough for this application

CF environment variables
------------------------
cf env app_name


VCAP_SERVICES and User Provided Services (USP)
------------------------
- VCAP_SERVICES env variable holds connection information for the service instance bound to the app
- User can define UPSI that populates VCAP_SERVICES with info on the external services such as DB, Messaging, logging
- VCAP_SERVICES can be populated by
	- Managed services
	- UPS
- NOT all managed services populate VCAP_SERVICES
- value is delivered directly to the user

- USP allow you to represent external assets as services 
	- e.g. Databases, Messaging, Logging
	- Populates VCAP_SERVICES env variable
- Benefits 
	- Manage the credentials for external services
	- Consistency - all service properties available in VCAP_SERVICES

- USPI Usage
1. create user provided service instance using "cf cups" cmd
2. bind app to the service using cli or GUI console
3. In the code get UPSI from VCAP_SERVICES
	e.g. in Java - env = System.getenv("VCAP_SERVICES");  
	
cf cups MyDB -p "url, user, pass"		// create user provided service. interactive
cf cups MyDB -p "{\"jdbc-url\":\"jdbc://url\", \"user\":\"id\", \"pass\":\"pwd\"}"		// create using json
cf services								// list user created services
cf delete-service MyDB					// delete service
