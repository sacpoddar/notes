A: DEA, Health Manager

Cloud Foundry CLI
--------------------
bluemix cf -h		// help
bluemix cf -h -a		// all help
bluemix cf -v		// version
bluemix login -u sac.poddar@gmail.com -o org_name -s space_name
bluemix target		// list target
bluemix cf logout 
bluemix cf passws	// change password
bluemix cf domains	// list domains
bluemix cf domain	
cf apps	// list apps

Q1: cf login -a option is needed to set the
A: API endpoint
Q2: Which cf cli command allows you to set the organization?
A: target
Q3: Orphaned routes are routes that are ____________ to any application
A: not attached
Q4: You just need to use cf create-domain to be able to create custom routes to your apps, no further action is needed
A: False
Q5: Which command is used for getting information about an app?
A: cf app
Q6: cf push command requires you to provide the ________ or/and __________
A) Manifest file
B) Application binaries (e.g., war file)
C) Command line parameters
D) API endpoint
A: A and C
Q7: You built an application that loads large amount of data at startup. You used the cf push command 
and received a timeout error and a message indicating the 0 of 1 instance started. How would you address the issue?
A: Mainfest file set a higher value for timeout; the default is 60 sec and that does not seem to be 
enough for this application

CF environment variables
------------------------
cf env app_name


VCAP_SERVICES and User Provided Services (USP)
------------------------
- VCAP_SERVICES env variable holds connection information for the service instance bound to the app
- User can define UPSI that populates VCAP_SERVICES with info on the external services such as DB, Messaging, logging
- VCAP_SERVICES can be populated by
	- Managed services
	- UPS
- NOT all managed services populate VCAP_SERVICES
- value is delivered directly to the user

- USP allow you to represent external assets as services 
	- e.g. Databases, Messaging, Logging
	- Populates VCAP_SERVICES env variable
- Benefits 
	- Manage the credentials for external services
	- Consistency - all service properties available in VCAP_SERVICES

- USPI Usage
1. create user provided service instance using "cf cups" cmd
2. bind app to the service using cli or GUI console
3. In the code get UPSI from VCAP_SERVICES
	e.g. in Java - env = System.getenv("VCAP_SERVICES");  
	
cf cups MyDB -p "url, user, pass"		// create user provided service. interactive
cf cups MyDB -p "{\"jdbc-url\":\"jdbc://url\", \"user\":\"id\", \"pass\":\"pwd\"}"		// create using json
cf services								// list user created services
cf delete-service MyDB					// delete service


12 Factor Apps
==============
https://12factor.net

- Methodology for building SaaS that
	- uses declarative format for setup automation
	- Suitable for deployment on cloud platform
	- Clean contract with the underlying resources to maximize portability
	- Minimize divergence between production and dev env

12 Factors
----------
1. Codebase
	- one codebase, many deploys. Deveper/Staging/Prod
	- each app in its own repo. Branches should be used for deployment to environments
2. Dependencies
	- explicitly declare and manage dependencies. e.g. build.gradle
	- automate the build process- repeatable deployments
3. Configuration
	- Store configuration in the environment variables. 
	- Anything that changes from env to env. e.g. DB URL
4. Backing services
	- Any services that the application uses- like Database, messaging, logging
	- Treat backing services as attached services. means app refers to the service by way of a url provided via the env variable.
	- Attach using cf bind- Using manifest file
	- Swapping the service should not require any code change
5. Build, release, run
	- Strictly separate build and run stages
	- Build 
		- compile code and package. e.g. gradle used to crate war file
		- one build many deploys
	- Release 
		- droplet created by- cf push
		- war/jar glued with whatever else is needed e.g JDK for java, Liberty for container, Tomcat
	- Run  
		- run using a single command- cf start
		- container provides the runtime
6. Stateless processess
	- Execute the apps as one or more stateless processes
	- No state info in memory or local file system ( no sticky session)
	- State of the system is defidned by the data in backing service such as database
								Instance-1
	User --> Load balancer -->	Instance-2  --> Backing service(Cache, NoSQL..)
								Instance-3		(User1, User2, User3.. )
								
7. Port binding
	- Export services via port binding
	- Export the app like a self contained service with a URL
		e.g. Java Springboot, NodeJS are used to craete self contained apps i.e. they do not 
		need an external web container
	- This way one app becomes the backing service for another app	
8. Concurrency
	- Scale out via the processes
	- Scale up - increase CPU, memory- Vertical scaling
	- Scale out - create additional instances of app - Horizontal scaling
	- An application process can benifit from vertical scaling upto a certain limit. At some point achieving
		higher levels of request processing concurrency is not possible.
	- Application should be designed in such a way that additional process instances may be created to cater
		to the increases traffic/load
9. Disposability
	- Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
	- Apps may be killed and restarted by the cloud platform without notification at any time
	- App startup should be fast. As a rule of thumb startup should not take more than 1 min.
	- App shitdown should be graceful e.g. close connections, ensure no job is locked
10. Dev/Prod parity
	- Keep Dev, Staging and Prod as similar as possible
	- Rerefers to
		- consistent config and app setup across all env
		- same backing service & their version across all env
	- Benifits are
		- Leads to fewer bugs in prod
		- faster delivery and continuous deployment
11. Logs
	- Treat logs as event streams
	- log to stdout and stderr
	- cloud platform takes care of
		- collating the log events/messages from all instances
		- routing of logs to a destination
	- Destination for logs
		- External to the app. Configured by way of user defined service (cf cups)
		- Log streams may be analyzed by extrenal system for generating reports/alerts
12. Admin processes
	- Run admin/mgmt processes as one off tasks
	- One-off admin processes should be run in an identical env as the regular process of the app
		 - build and expose admin processes as part of the app instead of external script
	- Admin code must ship with the release code so that they are in sync
		- Developer executing a admin process from his laptop is a bad practice
