Introduction to Cloud-Native Development
==============================

Cloud-native applications take advantage of cloud computing models to increase application development and 
delivery speed, deployment flexibility, and quality, while reducing deployment risks. 
This approach lets organizations get the most from innovative technologies like containers and microservices, and 
game-changing practices like Agile, DevOps, and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

key customer challenges, 
how cloud-native development can solve them, and 
how Red Hat solutions can be the foundation for your customers as they embark on this journey.

What is Cloud-native application development?
An approach to building and running applications to fully exploit the advantages of the cloud computing model, that is, 
to create applications that are responsive, elastic and resilient.  
Empowers organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, 
and hybrid clouds.

The primary characteristics of cloud-native development are applications that:  
- are packaged as containers 
- are orchestrated by platforms capable of running on top of any cloud infrastructure 
- adopt the principles of microservices and 
- are developed using practices such as continuous delivery and DevOps. 

These technologies and techniques enable systems with applications that are resilient, manageable, and observable. 
When these applications are combined with robust automation, IT teams (from both the "dev" and "ops" side, working 
collaboratively) have the power to make high-impact changes frequently, with minimal risk.

Cloud native development is all about accelerated application development and delivery to:  
- Build new applications and services to enable business innovation and transformation  
- Modernize existing applications to gain new value from existing IT investments 
- Connect new and existing applications together to drive new innovation and efficiency and gain competitive differentiation.

Benefits

 With DeoOps you can have both speed and quility

How RedHat support Cloud native development?
------------
The technical foundation of cloud native application development is based on the following four key technologies and techniques.  
1) Containers and orchestration
2) DevOps automation and continuous delivery
3) Microservices and service mesh
4) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and API management
 
These key cloud-native development technologies and techniques address process, infrastructure, and architecture improvements. 
With a cloud-native strategy, enterprises can maximize the speed of its application delivery, from initial 
- idea to 
- production release to 
- customer feedback, and, finally, to 
- enhancements based on user feedback while lowering risk.

Cloud-native development empowers organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments 
such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, 
declarative APIs and DevOps exemplify this approach. 
These technologies and techniques enable loosely coupled systems--in other words, applications--that are resilient, 
manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow IT (on both the Dev and Ops sides) to make 
high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal risk.

Who to contact? 
When you are talking to customers, you want to be mindful of the different roles people have in purchasing deliberations.  
- business leaders: are the power decision makers. 
 They want to use software applications to gain competitive advantage. They need IT to continuously deliver applications 
 with greater frequency and great user experience to advance digital business objectives and grow revenue and acquire new customers.  
- IT leaders: are buyer decision makers concerned with the speed of solution delivery. Wants standardization and 
 predictability of repeatable processes, platforms, and architectures. Cost of ownership and lowering risks is also 
 important to them. 
- application architects: are concerned with standards, support for choice of architectures, frameworks and 
 language runtimes, and agile development, DevOps and CI/CD automation. They also want portability, choice and 
 flexibility to run across hybrid multi clouds with consistency. 
- application developers: They are evaluator users who want development choices. They are concerned with languages 
 and architectural framework familiarity and support, developer tools, collaboration experience and learning resources. 
 
 Once you have sorted out the respective roles of your contacts, you will want to have a conversation strategy

Questions to ask? 
1.	What are the key application development projects in the next 18 months? 
2.	How do you balance application development versus legacy reuse versus SaaS and hosted services? 
3.	How do ensure your applications function across all the data centers and cloud locations you operate? 
4.	What are your plans for using the cloud for development? 
5.	How is your developer experience in your current software development processes? 
6.	What type of middleware application services, on-premise and cloud, are you currently using or planning to use in your development?



Introduction to Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure 
===========================
There are four basic models for cloud infrastructure: public cloud, private cloud, multicloud, and hybrid cloud. 
Public cloud:
- Subscription based service
- Used often for personal storage
- shared with others
- you don't  need to manage it
- no time limits or requirements 
- Easily transferable
Private cloud:
- You own or rent the entire facility
- You maintain and control the infrastructure and security
- You can customize it
Multicloud:
- using multiple clouds from many providers for numerous tasks.
- typically these clouds are public
	- To achieve greater flexibility, lowering costs, avoiding vendor lock-in, or using specific regional cloud providers. 
- increasingly, they also include private clouds
	- organization can use a private cloud instance without having to own or manage the infrastructure itself.  
- aligning each workload to the most optimal cloud infrastructure. 
Hybrid cloud:
- organizations have a combination of one or more public and private clouds that are orchestrated to work together for 
  a specific task or application. 
- difference between hybrid and multicloud is
	- When the use of public clouds is coordinated, that's hybrid; 
	- when the use of multiple public clouds is more opportunistic in nature, it is multicloud. 
- hybrid cloud environments include traditional private cloud infrastructures, such as bare-metal servers, 
  virtualization, programmable infrastructure such as OpenStack, or on-premises container platforms. 
  These separate cloud environments may remain unique entities, but workloads are able to traverse across them. 
- In the hybrid cloud environment, organizations maintain consistent policies, security, and access controls across 
  the enterprise via management and automation tools, integration, and APIs. When the cloud infrastructure is 
  engineered to work together, your customers' IT managers can operate with maximum security and ease of use. 

Public cloud advantages
-----------
- Convenient and easy
- Scalable
- available on-demand
- requires little in-house administration

limitation:
- costs associated with scaling, compliance, and security
- vendor lock-in
- may not be the right fit

Hybrid cloud advantages
-------------
- you can scale up or out as needed while still meeting your compliance, security, or workload-driven requirements: 
  Clouds support cloud-native applications by scaling out, while virtualization supports traditional workloads by scaling up. 
- your customers have greater flexibility in choosing the right vendor for the right task.  
- Hybrid cloud allows information and processes to be shared across the increasingly agile enterprise in an 
 orchestrated, interoperable fashion.  

Challenges:
- undefined cloud strategy
	- on traditional VM
	- no idea how to take advantage of cloud
	- need help understanding  options
- institutional knowledge gap
	- no idea about cloud technologies like openstack
	- who is going to manage workloads in a hybrid cloud configuration
- security and policy constraint
	- how can we offer users and developers a seft service option, regardless of infrastructure platform
	- how to ensure policy compliance for systems in cloud 

Benefits of RedHat Hybrid cloud
- greater ease of mgmt and automation
- make the most of existing investments while deploying newer assets and services
- services team can help customers overcome knowledge gap
- extensive partner system that support RedHat produts and services
- world class support, traininig and consulting services
- consistent enforcement of policies
	- sensitive information and critical systems can be kept on premises
	- less sensitive workloads can be moved to public cloud
	- RedHat can help customers device right strategies
	
Hybrid cloud infrastructure use cases
--------------
1. to accelerate adoption of public cloud infrastructure
  Advantage: Elasticity, Scalability, Speed
  Challenges:
	- Providers infrastructure, mgmt and automation software may be different from what the IT orsganization uses
		in its own datacenters
	- Vendor lock-in that can occur as customers adopt the services and tools of those vendors
  Red Hat has worked closely with all of the key cloud providers to certify and make available the Red Hat technology 
  portfolio on that cloud provider via the Red Hat Certified Cloud and Service Provider program, or "CCSP." 
  As a result, customers will enjoy a consistent operational environment and reduce lock-in to any one cloud. 
2. to run containers at scale across hybrid and multicloud environments.
  Once customers have moved some workloads to the public cloud, they may find that 
  - they need to keep other workloads on-site due to regulatory or security concerns, or
  - they want to use multiple cloud vendors due to geographic or performance considerations. 
  What is the best way for them to incorporate hybrid cloud or multicloud computing? 
  By extending their strategy of taking advantage of the enterprise-grade Red Hat portfolio on the public cloud 
  (thanks to CCSP and Cloud Access programs), customers can adopt the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to take 
  advantage of Kubernetes and containers and extend to hybrid or multicloud computing.  
  With Red Hat hybrid cloud infrastructure, customers can 
  - use containers in a hybrid cloud environment, and 
  - have application portability across private and public clouds. 
  - They will have a consistent operational model and a 
  - common application platform for accelerated application development through production on any cloud.
  
RedHat Solutions
-----------------
1. Accelerate adoption of public cloud infrastructure
  Red Hat makes it very easy to consume Red Hat solutions on the public cloud. 
  Customers can run the Red Hat technology stack that they trust across their datacenters on the major cloud providers today.
- CCSP (Certified Cloud and Service Provider)
  Through the CCSP program, Red Hat works with the cloud providers to engineer, test, and certify Red Hat solutions on 
  that cloud provider. 
- Red Hat Cloud Access
  allows Red Hat customers to easily migrate their existing Red Hat product license subscriptions to the cloud.
- Also through CCSP, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is available as the operating system to run on virtual machines and 
  machine images hosted by the cloud provider. This gives the customer the benefits of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
  (such as security, performance, and reliability), which they can enjoy in the datacenter in the public cloud.  
- With Red Hat Enterprise Linux available everywhere, this also means that Red Hat portfolio solutions such as 
  Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can also be used on these public cloud platforms. 
- With Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform running on the public cloud, customers can 
  accelerate the delivery of applications and services for the business. 
- With the help of Red Hat Services, customers can readily address the technical complexity associated with cloud 
  adoption and focus on transforming their business culture.  
- Finally, Red Hat Open Innovation Labs provides a powerful workshop residency environment that can quickly help the 
  customer find the solutions they need.

2. Run containers at scale across hybrid and multicloud environments.
- The Red Hat approach to this use case is to abstract away the details of the underlying cloud providers. 
  Customers do this by running the Red Hat portfolio on those providers to implement a common application platform across multiple clouds.  
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs wherever Red Hat Enterprise Linux runs, so it becomes easy to deploy and 
  run it on any of the Red Hat certified cloud partners. 
- With Red Hat OpenShift, organizations can take advantage of the leading Kubernetes-based container platform to easily 
  build, deploy, and run both cloud-native and traditional stateful applications.  
- And with Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes, the Red Hat middleware software portfolio for OpenShift, application 
  development becomes faster and easier. 
- When Red Hat Insights, which is included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions, and Red Hat Satellite, which is 
  included with Red Hat Smart Management subscriptions, are added, it becomes even easier to manage a hybrid cloud 
  infrastructure solution.  
- Furthermore, OpenShift Operators assists with automating the deployment and management of software within OpenShift, 
  and customers can use cloud.redhat.com for a SaaS interface to multicloud management by Red Hat. 
- Also, Containers on Cloud provides a proven approach and side-by-side mentoring to accelerate business agility. 
  This offering combines container-native workloads with Infrastructure-as-a-Service (or "IaaS") across physical, 
  virtual, and cloud infrastructures.  
- With Red Hat Services, customers can address the complexity of deploying containers on cloud and focus on 
  transforming organizational culture. 
- Finally, in today's environment, security is critical. The Red Hat hybrid and multicloud infrastructure portfolio is 
  built from the ground up on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which utilizes Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, and has 
  been hardened over the course of 25 years of development.  
- Trusted by Fortune 500 companies. Red Hat is an industry leader in security management and vulnerability mitigation.

How to sell RedHat OpenShift Container platform
===================================

What is it?
-----------
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a Kubernetes-based container platform for securely developing, deploying 
	and running cloud-native applications. 
- It allows organizations to accelerate and streamline application development and deployment-on-premise, in the 
	public cloud, or in a hybrid of both.   
- With OpenShift, each infrastructure deployment shares the same management tooling, which enables true hybrid cloud 
	use cases and a consistent user experience. 
- Both IT operations and development teams can standardize their processes around one interface.  
- Red Hat OpenShift is based on enterprise-grade open source technology. It includes a broad ecosystem of software 
	components, such as Docker-formatted container technology, Kubernetes container orchestration, Red Hat Enterprise 
	Linux CoreOS, and more, all of which are backed by Red Hat and its partners.

Why customers choose it?
-----------------------
- While Kubernetes is a key component of this infrastructure, it is only one part of the deployment solution.   
- There are a number of additional components that will need to be pieced together, tested, and hardened for "day 2" 
	operations, including networking, security, storage, GPU support, load balancing, service mesh, serverless, 
	pipelines, and more.  
- No matter what infrastructure your customers choose, whether it's bare metal, virtual infrastructure, private cloud, 
	or public cloud, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform includes a developer-friendly, consistent user experience.

DevOps support?
-------
- DevOps is a transformative process that brings developers and IT operations teams together to produce software in 
short iterative cycles.   
- OpenShift supports DevOps processes by enabling developers to build and deploy applications at the click of a button, 
	while providing operations teams the ability to manage application deployments to meet performance, security, 
	and compliance requirements. 

what does it solves? - use cases
-------------
1. Deploy a multicloud container platform
- With Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, customers have a comprehensive platform built to install across a hybrid 
	cloud infrastructure that will ensure their company's ability to innovate.  
- The user experience is always consistent using OpenShift, which reduces the complexity in managing and deploying 
	applications across a hybrid cloud.
2. Accelerate application development with containers
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports cloud-native application development by streamlining and automating 
	development processes. 
	This allows your clients to accelerate application delivery with containers.   
- Red Hat OpenShift accelerates product life cycles by giving developers more control over their environment and 
	self-service to a wide choice of tools and components. 
- The developer interface remains consistent across all hybrid cloud infrastructures, reducing the effort required 
	to adapt the process for each unique target.

who is a good prospect?
---------------
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform appeals to organizations of all sizes, from startups to global enterprises 
	across all verticals and industries.   
- Look for customers that are committed to being responsive to the needs of their customers. and who have recognized 
	that the current model is not supporting the agility they need to be responsive.    
- They may have already determined their future is built around containers, or they may be early in investigating what 
	cloud-native applications look like and how they can transform their capabilities. 

who do i reach out to?
-------------------
- It is important to involve people from both IT operations and development organizations to make sure they clearly 
	understand how OpenShift enables teams to achieve business outcomes together.  
- CTO and the enterprise or application architects. They are trying to modernize applications and build forward-looking
	processes and frameworks to drive their business toward its goals.  
- Development leads are good prospects because they want to give their team of developers a choice of commercially 
	supported tools, languages, and frameworks, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery, or CI/CD.   
- IT operations leaders are also target buyers as they look to support the consumption and deployment agility their 
	development team needs.
- engage the security team to hear their concerns about compliance and how the OpenShift may address their concerns.
- CIOs and line of business executives are driven to expedite innovation and time to market, and to explore new business 
	opportunities through software. 

questions to ask?
-------------------
C-suite or Business leaders:
- focus on the business value that derives from technology. They may not be interested in the particulars of the technology itself.
- "What are your competitors doing that you would like to do?" 
- "What are your upcoming priorities?" 
- "What skills gaps may be preventing your teams from effectively adopting containers?" 
- "What is your company's cloud strategy, and do you plan to expand your public or private cloud initiatives?"

development leaders and teams:
- focus on developer benefits that ship with OpenShift. Introduce the OpenShift developer console and show how it aligns to developer workflows.
- "When a developer asks for a specific environment, how long does it take until the actual application deployment?  
- "How do you manage upgrade processes for your production environments?" 
- "How many containers are you deploying? How do you see that scaling?  Are you using service mesh to manage the 
 	interconnection between each"? 
- "What programming languages or frameworks do you use?"  
- "Are you using a standard pipeline tool?" 
- "Which new capabilities are you interested in adopting?"  

IT operations teams:
- are concerned about the availability and uptime, security, cost, scalability of the infrastructure, and being able 
	to define on-premise or cloud infrastructure requirements for applications. 
- "How do you ensure high availability for your services?" 
- "How do you scale in case of peak usage?" 
- "How much time does it take to clone one of your existing environments?" 
- "Are you looking for easier portability between on-premise and cloud environments?" 
- "How much time do you spend patching security fixes?" 
- "Do you have future VMware products you need to support?"

How to handle objections: DIY kubernetes
--------------------------
- Because OpenShift consists of open source technologies, some customers might think they can do-it themselves   

Q:	"Why can't we just build it ourselves? We can install Docker and Kubernetes."   
A: Docker and Kubernetes are just two of the building blocks needed for a complete container platform. 
- OpenShift adds easy management of registry and image streams for container image version tracking with automated builds. 
- OpenShift also supports developer tools, middleware, service mesh, serverless deployments, integration with pipelines 
	and persistent storage for stateful applications.  
- Kubernetes also doesn't ship with a Linux distribution, and Linux is key for containers.  

- The value of OpenShift is that customers can choose to manage a platform themselves with OpenShift Container Platform 
	or they can use a managed service like OpenShift Dedicated or Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

How to handle objections: public cloud-managed kubernetes
-------------------------
Q: "It's easier and cheaper if we just use managed Kubernetes from public cloud." 
A: Red Hat OpenShift is a more complete solution that includes many of the management and lifecycle tools needed for 
	a true application platform. This means customers won't waste time searching for missing components that are 
	outside of Kubernetes itself. 
	Second, public cloud vendors manage only part of the Kubernetes infrastructure, while customers own and are 
	responsible for managing and securing all their applications and worker nodes. 
	OpenShift also helps customers retain flexibility for hybrid cloud deployments and avoid cloud vendor lock-in.

How to sell RedHat OpenShift Container storage
===================================
- a container, by nature, is transient. If the container is rebooted, all the data stored in container is lost.
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage provides dynamic, stateful, and highly available container-native storage that 
	can be provisioned and de-provisioned on demand using Kubernetes API calls, while the monitoring and management of 
	the storage cluster is an integral part of the OpenShift Administrator Console.
- it's a persistent software-defined storage integrated with and optimized for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage is engineered, tested, and qualified to work with Red Hat OpenShift Container 
	Platform on any infrastructure. 
- Together, these technologies provide everything needed for hybrid cloud, enterprise container development and 
	deployment, controlled by Kubernetes. This tight integration removes the guesswork from running Red Hat 
	OpenShift across multiple platforms.
- Developers gain consistency in how their applications interact with their data, wherever the application is deployed, 
	on-premise or in the cloud. And they have all this while providing the data storage functionality, data services, 
	and data protection that enterprises require.

	- block storage for databases and messaging, 
	- shared file storage for continuous integration and data aggregation, 
	- object storage for archival, backup, and media storage.
	
Line of business managers, including C-level business leaders: they need
- make cloud-native deployments enterprise-ready. 
- empower individual business units—for example, so they can buy OpenShift and run it wherever they need it. 
- concerned about simplicity and the speed of deployment. 
- meet application requirements, including the application’s data, with one vendor.
- avoid cloud lock-in and maintain the ability to move applications and data between clouds and on-premise environments.

IT operations: they need
- cloud-like enterprise, everywhere.

- flexibility to code against the standard Kubernetes persistent volume APIs for block and file access
- develop, test and deploy end-to-end with one consistent platform.
 
questions to ask?
----------------
Lines of business and C-suite leaders:
	- focus on questions that address their high-level business goals and challenges. 
- “What types of cloud-based application growth are you experiencing?” 
- “Do you use multiple public cloud providers today, or do you anticipate deploying hybrid or multicloud solutions in 
	the future? How do you expect to scale?” 
- “What kinds of data-intensive applications are you running?” 
- “What is slowing down your business and ability to deploy new applications faster?” 
- “Is the data for their cloud-based applications transient or does it need to be stored permanently?"

Head of IT operations:
	- enquire about their hybrid- or multicloud plans; depending on their business needs, organizations may be seeking 
	easier portability between on-premise and cloud environments, which OpenShift Container Storage helps provide.
- “How do you ensure high availability for your storage services?” 
- “How do you scale in case of peak storage usage?” 
- “How much time does it take to clone one of your existing environments, and their migration strategy?” 
- “How much time do you have to spend patching security fixes, and is this a big issue for your organization?” 
- “What business needs are driving your cloud-native plans?” 

Head of Development:
	- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage provides persistent storage for many popular development workflows like 
	CI/CD pipelines, SQL/NoSQL databases, and AI/ML applications. This means development teams can likely make good 
	use of their investments without disrupting their current processes. 
- “What kinds of data-intensive applications are you running? Which are stateful versus stateless?” 
- “Do these data intensive applications need a unified block, file, and S3 object storage? Do they require persistent access to data?”
- “Do your applications require multicloud support?”
- “How long does it take from the time a developer asks for a specific environment to actual application deployment?”

objections : we already have storage
-----------
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage provides additional value and features such as data protection, data portability, 
	and is fully integrated into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
- The solution works with both OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure and existing storage environments (such as Amazon EBS, NetApp, and others).

objections : most of our workloads are static
-----------
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage provides data protection, availability, and portability for traditional 
	application workloads, as well as emerging application workloads requiring static and dynamic data.

objections : using a traditional storage vendor
-----------
- Legacy storage typically provides static provisioning mode and lacks the portability and agility required by 
	container platforms. 
- Legacy platforms do not provide developers a unified platform that supports block, file, and object storage for 
	cloud-native applications. 
- It also suffers from a monolithic appliance model with vendor lock-in, and high TCO, or total cost of ownership. 
- Finally, legacy storage requires a separate management system and is not integrated into the OpenShift Container 
	Platform management console.
	
objections : using a public cloud
-----------
- Public cloud storage options are missing key features, such as recovering persistent volume claims across availability zones. 
- Public cloud storage doesn't offer storage federation for multicloud as they are trying to lock customers into their platform. 
- Public cloud providers also do not provide portability across other public clouds. 

pricing
---------
The subscription pricing for Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage is based on core pairs (that is 2-core).
- The OpenShift Container Storage nodes will not be counted against the OpenShift Container Platform subscription. 
- This means that the customer only pays for OpenShift Container Storage SKUs, and not for OpenShift Container Platform, 
	even though OpenShift Container Platform is actually running underneath OpenShift Container Storage. 
- This is a pricing advantage for OpenShift Container Storage compared to other solutions because customers can save 
	money by not needing additional OpenShift Container Platform licenses.
- OpenShift Container Storage 3 subscriptions are the same as OpenShift Container Storage 4; there is no additional cost or need to transfer.
- Based on the level of support required, OpenShift Container Storage is sold as either Standard or Premium subscription, 
	and the subscription is available for either one or three years. 
	
bigger picture
----------
- most storage infrastructure used by development teams was not developed or optimized for microservices and containers.
- development teams will need software-defined, container-based storage that is easy to use, highly available, flexible, 
	and allows for faster development cycles for their stateful applications and services.
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage was created specifically for container-based environments and is highly integrated 
	with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
- Now your customers can have a single vendor in Red Hat to provide support for the entire container-based environment, 
	including containers, orchestration, and storage.
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage combined with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform offers a complete open source 
	solution for hybrid cloud and a unified DevOps experience.
- So, when you talk to customers about Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage, your biggest ally will be a solution your customers are already using: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
