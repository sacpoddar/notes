Introduction to Cloud-Native Development
==============================

Cloud-native applications take advantage of cloud computing models to increase application development and 
delivery speed, deployment flexibility, and quality, while reducing deployment risks. 
This approach lets organizations get the most from innovative technologies like containers and microservices, and 
game-changing practices like Agile, DevOps, and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

key customer challenges, 
how cloud-native development can solve them, and 
how Red Hat solutions can be the foundation for your customers as they embark on this journey.

What is Cloud-native application development?
An approach to building and running applications to fully exploit the advantages of the cloud computing model, that is, 
to create applications that are responsive, elastic and resilient.  
Empowers organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, 
and hybrid clouds.

The primary characteristics of cloud-native development are applications that:  
- are packaged as containers 
- are orchestrated by platforms capable of running on top of any cloud infrastructure 
- adopt the principles of microservices and 
- are developed using practices such as continuous delivery and DevOps. 

These technologies and techniques enable systems with applications that are resilient, manageable, and observable. 
When these applications are combined with robust automation, IT teams (from both the “dev” and “ops” side, working 
collaboratively) have the power to make high-impact changes frequently, with minimal risk.

Cloud native development is all about accelerated application development and delivery to:  
- Build new applications and services to enable business innovation and transformation  
- Modernize existing applications to gain new value from existing IT investments 
- Connect new and existing applications together to drive new innovation and efficiency and gain competitive differentiation.

How RedHat support Cloud native development?
------------
The technical foundation of cloud native application development is based on the following four key technologies and techniques.  
1) Containers and orchestration
2) DevOps automation and continuous delivery
3) Microservices and service mesh
4) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and API management
 
These key cloud-native development technologies and techniques address process, infrastructure, and architecture improvements. 
With a cloud-native strategy, enterprises can maximize the speed of its application delivery, from initial 
- idea to 
- production release to 
- customer feedback, and, finally, to 
- enhancements based on user feedback while lowering risk.

Cloud-native development empowers organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments 
such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, 
declarative APIs and DevOps exemplify this approach. 
These technologies and techniques enable loosely coupled systems--in other words, applications--that are resilient, 
manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow IT (on both the Dev and Ops sides) to make 
high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal risk.

Who to contact? 
When you are talking to customers, you want to be mindful of the different roles people have in purchasing deliberations.  
- business leaders: are the power decision makers. 
 They want to use software applications to gain competitive advantage. They need IT to continuously deliver applications 
 with greater frequency and great user experience to advance digital business objectives and grow revenue and acquire new customers.  
- IT leaders: are buyer decision makers concerned with the speed of solution delivery. Wants standardization and 
 predictability of repeatable processes, platforms, and architectures. Cost of ownership and lowering risks is also 
 important to them. 
- application architects: are concerned with standards, support for choice of architectures, frameworks and 
 language runtimes, and agile development, DevOps and CI/CD automation. They also want portability, choice and 
 flexibility to run across hybrid multi clouds with consistency. 
- application developers: They are evaluator users who want development choices. They are concerned with languages 
 and architectural framework familiarity and support, developer tools, collaboration experience and learning resources. 
 
 Once you have sorted out the respective roles of your contacts, you will want to have a conversation strategy

Questions to ask? 
1.	What are the key application development projects in the next 18 months? 
2.	How do you balance application development versus legacy reuse versus SaaS and hosted services? 
3.	How do ensure your applications function across all the data centers and cloud locations you operate? 
4.	What are your plans for using the cloud for development? 
5.	How is your developer experience in your current software development processes? 
6.	What type of middleware application services, on-premise and cloud, are you currently using or planning to use in your development?



Introduction to Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure 
===========================
There are four basic models for cloud infrastructure: public cloud, private cloud, multicloud, and hybrid cloud. 
Public cloud:
- Subscription based service
- Used often for personal storage
- shared with others
- you don't  need to manage it
- no time limits or requirements 
- Easily transferable
Private cloud:
- You own or rent the entire facility
- You maintain and control the infrastructure and security
- You can customize it
Multicloud:
- using multiple clouds from many providers for numerous tasks.
- typically these clouds are public
	- To achieve greater flexibility, lowering costs, avoiding vendor lock-in, or using specific regional cloud providers. 
- increasingly, they also include private clouds
	- organization can use a private cloud instance without having to own or manage the infrastructure itself.  
- aligning each workload to the most optimal cloud infrastructure. 
Hybrid cloud:
- organizations have a combination of one or more public and private clouds that are orchestrated to work together for 
  a specific task or application. 
- difference between hybrid and multicloud is
	- When the use of public clouds is coordinated, that's hybrid; 
	- when the use of multiple public clouds is more opportunistic in nature, it is multicloud. 
- hybrid cloud environments include traditional private cloud infrastructures, such as bare-metal servers, 
  virtualization, programmable infrastructure such as OpenStack, or on-premises container platforms. 
  These separate cloud environments may remain unique entities, but workloads are able to traverse across them. 
- In the hybrid cloud environment, organizations maintain consistent policies, security, and access controls across 
  the enterprise via management and automation tools, integration, and APIs. When the cloud infrastructure is 
  engineered to work together, your customers’ IT managers can operate with maximum security and ease of use. 

Public cloud advantages
-----------
- Convenient and easy
- Scalable
- available on-demand
- requires little in-house administration

limitation:
- costs associated with scaling, compliance, and security
- vendor lock-in
- may not be the right fit

Hybrid cloud advantages
-------------
- you can scale up or out as needed while still meeting your compliance, security, or workload-driven requirements: 
  Clouds support cloud-native applications by scaling out, while virtualization supports traditional workloads by scaling up. 
- your customers have greater flexibility in choosing the right vendor for the right task.  
- Hybrid cloud allows information and processes to be shared across the increasingly agile enterprise in an 
 orchestrated, interoperable fashion.  

Challenges:
- undefined cloud strategy
	- on traditional VM
	- no idea how to take advantage of cloud
	- need help understanding  options
- institutional knowledge gap
	- no idea about cloud technologies like openstack
	- who is going to manage workloads in a hybrid cloud configuration
- security and policy constraint
	- how can we offer users and developers a seft service option, regardless of infrastructure platform
	- how to ensure policy compliance for systems in cloud 

Benefits of RedHat Hybrid cloud
- greater ease of mgmt and automation
- make the most of existing investments while deploying newer assets and services
- services team can help customers overcome knowledge gap
- extensive partner system that support RedHat produts and services
- world class support, traininig and consulting services
- consistent enforcement of policies
	- sensitive information and critical systems can be kept on premises
	- less sensitive workloads can be moved to public cloud
	- RedHat can help customers device right strategies
	
Hybrid cloud infrastructure use cases
--------------
1. to accelerate adoption of public cloud infrastructure
  Advantage: Elasticity, Scalability, Speed
  Challenges:
	- Providers infrastructure, mgmt and automation software may be different from what the IT orsganization uses
		in its own datacenters
	- Vendor lock-in that can occur as customers adopt the services and tools of those vendors
  Red Hat has worked closely with all of the key cloud providers to certify and make available the Red Hat technology 
  portfolio on that cloud provider via the Red Hat Certified Cloud and Service Provider program, or “CCSP.” 
  As a result, customers will enjoy a consistent operational environment and reduce lock-in to any one cloud. 
2. to run containers at scale across hybrid and multicloud environments.
  Once customers have moved some workloads to the public cloud, they may find that 
  - they need to keep other workloads on-site due to regulatory or security concerns, or
  - they want to use multiple cloud vendors due to geographic or performance considerations. 
  What is the best way for them to incorporate hybrid cloud or multicloud computing? 
  By extending their strategy of taking advantage of the enterprise-grade Red Hat portfolio on the public cloud 
  (thanks to CCSP and Cloud Access programs), customers can adopt the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to take 
  advantage of Kubernetes and containers and extend to hybrid or multicloud computing.  
  With Red Hat hybrid cloud infrastructure, customers can 
  - use containers in a hybrid cloud environment, and 
  - have application portability across private and public clouds. 
  - They will have a consistent operational model and a 
  - common application platform for accelerated application development through production on any cloud.
